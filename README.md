## 🛠 Arch Linux Installation & Prerequisites

Zaknotes is optimized for Arch Linux. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### 1. Install System Dependencies
Zaknotes requires `ffmpeg` for audio processing and `nodejs` to solve YouTube's "n challenge" via the EJS solver.

```bash
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg nodejs
```

### 2. Install UV (Modern Python Package Manager)
We use `uv` for lightning-fast dependency management and virtual environments.

```bash
sudo pacman -S uv
```

### 3. Clone & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShoyebOP/Zaknotes-python-varient.git
cd Zaknotes-python-varient
uv sync
```

## 📖 Feature Deep-Dive

Zaknotes offers a granular CLI interface to manage your learning materials.

### 1. Note Generation Sub-Menu
- **Start New Jobs (Cancel Old Jobs):** Clears the current queue and starts a fresh batch.
- **Start New Jobs (Add to Queue):** Appends new links to your existing processing queue.
- **Cancel All Old Jobs:** Flushes the queue without starting new work.
- **Process Old Jobs:** Resumes processing any pending links in the queue.

### 2. Manage API Keys
Zaknotes supports multiple API keys to help you stay within free tier limits.
- **Add/Remove Keys:** Easily cycle through your available Gemini keys.
- **View Quota Status:** Get a real-time report of usage per key. If a key returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error, Zaknotes automatically marks it as **[EXHAUSTED]** for the day and cycles to the next one.

### 3. Configure Audio Chunking
Long lectures are automatically split into manageable parts for the AI.
- **Default:** 1800s (30 minutes).
- **Customization:** You can increase or decrease this based on the complexity of the content or API stability.

### 4. Cleanup Stranded Audio Chunks
If a process is interrupted, temporary audio files might remain. Use this option to safely purge the `temp/` directory and reclaim disk space.

### 5. Refresh Cookies
For platforms requiring authentication (like some Facebook or private classroom videos), use this to update your `cookies/bangi.txt` file via an interactive paste.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "429 Too Many Requests"
This means your Gemini API key has hit its limit for the day (20 requests per model).
- **Solution:** Add more API keys via **Option 2** in the main menu. Zaknotes will automatically cycle through all available keys.

### YouTube "n challenge" or Extraction Errors
If `yt-dlp` fails to download from YouTube, it usually means it cannot find a JavaScript runtime.
- **Solution:** Ensure `nodejs` is installed and the `node` command is available in your PATH. Run `node --version` to verify.

### 403 Forbidden (Facebook/Private Links)
- **Solution:** Your cookies may have expired. Use **Option 5: Refresh Cookies** to update your authentication state.

### Stranded Files
If the tool crashes, you might see large files in the `temp/` directory.
- **Solution:** Use **Option 4: Cleanup Stranded Audio Chunks** to free up space.
